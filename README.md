# DataEstructures
This contains the basic data structures implementation (vector,list,tree,hashmap).
It was made for the Data Structure and algorithms course from Computer Science bachelor.

This structures are not generic yet, they are based on preset structs. This will need to be changed in the future,
by replacing this structures into void pointers.
